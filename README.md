Enjoying the journey of trying to be a great programmer. Learning how to walk right now, but one day I'll be making some pretty cool stuff.

Random facts

- Sophmore at Kutztown University
- Emacs enjoyer
- Grows a mediocre mustache from time to time
- Shamelessly copied the readme format of [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ThePrimeagen)
